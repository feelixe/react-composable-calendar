## Guides

### Timezone
To change the timezone of the calendar, pass a time to the prop `timezone` on the `Calendar.Root`.
A list of valid timezones can be found in the <ExternalLink href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones" text="IANA Database" />.

#### Notes
- If you want to use `UTC` as timezone, do not use `.tz("UTC")`, instead use `dayjs().utc()`.
- When using a controlled state or passing a `defaultValue`, ensure the date provided is set to the same timezone.
<CodeBlock client:load code={codeExamples.timezone} />

## Form Input
To use the calendar as a uncontrolled input field, make sure you render the `Calendar.FormInput` somewhere inside the root.
Then all you need to do is pass a name for the form input. (If in `range` mode you need to pass two names)
<CodeBlock client:load code={codeExamples.formInput} />

## Components

### Calendar.Root
The Root component is the foundational wrapper for the calendar. It manages the calendar's state,
including the current view, selected date(s), and mode (single or range). It also provides context
to its child components, allowing them to access and modify the calendar's state.

<Separator className="my-8" />

### Calendar.View
Provides context for a view. A view is a month that is being viewed.
You can have multiple views within a calendar root.

<Separator className="my-8" />

### Calendar.OffsetViewButton
A Button that offset the current view but a number.

<Separator className="my-8" />

### Calendar.ViewOffset
This will offset all children with an amount. Useful if you for example want to show two views
next to each other where one of them is them next month.

<Separator className="my-8" />

### Calendar.Weekdays
The Weekdays component is responsible for rendering the weekday labels (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.) in
the calendar.

<Separator className="my-8" />

### Calendar.WeekdayLabel
The WeekdayLabel component is used to display the name of a weekday (e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday")
within the calendar. It retrieves the current weekday index from the WeekdayContext.

<Separator className="my-8" />

### Calendar.MonthTitle
Shows the name of the month that the view is currently in.

<Separator className="my-8" />

### Calendar.Days

<Separator className="my-8" />

<Separator className="my-8" />

### Calendar.DayLabel
Renders the day's number in the month.

<Separator className="my-8" />

### Calendar.FormInput
Renders an `<input />` with the calendars value. If in `range` mode, two inputs will be rendered.

<Separator className="my-8" />

### Calendar.ClearButton

<Separator className="my-8" />

### Calendar.DayInRange
Conditionally rendered if a day is within the selected range.

<Separator className="my-8" />

### Calendar.DayIsToday

<Separator className="my-8" />
